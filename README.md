# 2019-Java-Group27
Project Authors: Jonathan Browne, Blake Williams

* A Zelda-like game developed over the course of ~4 weeks
* Most visual assets, excluding player character and chest images where created by Jonathan Browne

## Running the Game
* To run simply run the executable NightKnight.jar file
* It is possible to also run the game through the Eclipse IDE for Java Developers by importing the project from the 27_NightKnight folder
  the scoreboard and some sounds will work when running the game this way. If you chose to do this, simply run the game using the 'Run' 
  option in the Eclipse toolbar

## How to play
* Use 'W' and 'S' to navigate in the menu and 'ENTER' to select an option
* In-game you can press 'P' to pause and 'P' again to unpause; pressing 'ESCAPE' while paused immediately closes the game
* Other controls are shown when you first start the game
* You do not have to kill any enemies except the final boss to win the game

## Known Issues:
* Game is unfinished, there are no melee attack animations, the red box when holding a weapon denotes where damage will be dealt to enemies
  upon pressing the attack button
* When running the .jar exe version of the game the scoreboard in the menu and death/victory screen does not work
* Very occassionally the game may freeze and will have to be restarted
* Sounds do not work in the .jar exe version of the game and mostly do not work runnin the game through the eclipse IDE
